Description: system-wide service supervision
 runit is a collection of tools to provide system-wide service supervision
 and to manage services.  Contrary to sysv init, it not only cares about
 starting and stopping services, but also supervises the service daemons
 while they are running.  Amongst other things, it provides a reliable
 interface to send signals to service daemons without the need for pid-files,
 and a log facility with automatic log file rotation and disk space limits.
 .
 runit service supervision can run under sysv init, systemd or replace the init
 system completely. Complete init replacement is provided by 'runit-init'
 package. Users that want to take advantage of runit supervision under systemd
 or sysv init can directly install the 'runit-run' package.

Description: service supervision (systemd and sysv integration)
 runit is a collection of tools to provide system-wide service supervision
 and to manage services.  Contrary to sysv init, it not only cares about
 starting and stopping services, but also supervises the service daemons
 while they are running.  Amongst other things, it provides a reliable
 interface to send signals to service daemons without the need for pid-files,
 and a log facility with automatic log file rotation and disk space limits.
 .
 This package provides service file to start runit supervision via systemd
 and an entry in /etc/inittab that respawns the supervision tree for sysv
 users.

Description: transitional package for runit-systemd users
 This is a transitional empty package to smooth the transition from
 runit-systemd to runit-run. See #976187 for details. When runit-run
 is successfully installed this package can be removed.

Description: system-wide service supervision (as init system)
 runit is a collection of tools to provide system-wide service supervision
 and to manage services.  Contrary to sysv init, it not only cares about
 starting and stopping services, but also supervises the service daemons
 while they are running.  Amongst other things, it provides a reliable

 and a log facility with automatic log file rotation and disk space limits.
 .
 This package provides /sbin/init as a symlink to runit-init so that the system
 will automatically boot with runit; it also provides compatibility symlinks
 (shutdown, halt, reboot, poweroff) that are expected by desktop environments
 and other system tools.
 Installing this package will remove the 'init' metapackage and requires the
 user to type the 'Yes, do as I say!' phrase.  See #923450 for details.
